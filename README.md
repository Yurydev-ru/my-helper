## Step 2: Configure your site

_You turned on GitHub Pages! :tada:_

We'll work in a branch, `my-pages`, that I created for you to get this site looking great. :sparkle:

Jekyll uses a file titled `_config.yml` to store settings for your site, your theme, and reusable content like your site title and GitHub handle. You can check out the `_config.yml` file on the **Code** tab of your repository.

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.
1. Click **Pages** in the **Code and automation** section.
1. Ensure "Deploy from a branch" is selected from the **Source** drop-down menu, and then select `main` from the **Branch** drop-down menu.
1. Click the **Save** button.
1. Wait about _one minute_ then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
> Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. GitHub Actions may take up to a minute to respond while waiting for the deployment. Future steps will be about 20 seconds; this step is slower.
> **Note**: In the **Pages** of **Settings**, the **Visit site** button will appear at the top. Click the button to see your GitHub Pages site.
